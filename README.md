This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Email Configuration

To enable the contact form functionality, you need to set up email credentials:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
RECIPIENT_EMAIL=info@ledmedia.ua
```

2. If using Gmail, you'll need to create an App Password:
   - Go to your Google Account > Security
   - Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled
   - Create an App Password for "Mail"
   - Use the generated password as EMAIL_PASS

3. For production deployment, add these environment variables to your hosting provider.
